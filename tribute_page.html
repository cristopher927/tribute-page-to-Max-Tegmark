			<p class="big-p">Max Tegmark (born 5 May 1967) is a famous Swedish-American cosmologist, professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the scientific director of the Foundational Questions Institute.
      
		 He's in love with scientific research and had many public speeches about cosmology and physics. Tegmark is one of the scientists that truly believe that our Universe is just a tiny part from an amount of many other Universes which together form the so-called "Multiverse".</>
			<h3>You can see Tegmark in action here and so in many other YouTube videos:</h3>

		  	<h3 class="h3">Let's have a closer look at this incredibile man's life:</h3>

			<p>
				<b>- 1967:</b> this is the year when Max Tegmark first saw daylight. He was born in Sweden from father Harold S. Shapiro and mother Karin Tegmark. His father also was a great scientist, being an illustrious mathematician which received his Ph.D. in 1952 from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
			</p>

				<h3>Studies:</h3>

				<p>Tegmark was a curious and smart student and also an inventor even since high school. No, he didn't invent excuses to skip classes, I'm talking here about pure science. The Swedish teenager of those days invented a 3D version of the famous video game Tetris and also a word processor written in machine code for the eight-bit computer ABC 80.
				 <br><br>
					He graduated the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden and the Stockholm School of Economics and later received his PhD from the University of California, Berkeley. 
				</p>

				<h3>Career:</h3>

				<p>Before being a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, he worked at the  University of Pennsylvania.<br><br>

				Being interested and deeply involved in topics like quanthum mechanics, cosmic microwave background, theories about gravitation and inflation, the so-called "Theory of Everything" and the concept of Multiverse , Max Tegmark has over 200 scientific publications where he talks about all this fancy stuff.<br><br>

				Probably Tegmark's most important publication is <i><b>Our Mathematical Universe: My Quest for the Ultimate Nature of Reality</b></i>, a book publicated in 2014 where the Swedish-American cosmologist describes in a friendly way the mathematical universe hypothesis, using both scientific explanations and entertaining anecdotes.</p>

				<h3>Personal life:</h3>

				<p>Where would a guy be without love? Probably he could never be a scientist. Max Tegmark married his current wife Meia Chita in 2012, but before he was married to the astrophycisist Angelica de Oliveira-Costa until 2009, when the two divorced. Tegmark has two sons from his first marriage.</p>

				<p style="font-size: 30px;text-align: center;">I think you should definitely read more about this great scientist who is addicted to reality and to its vast exploration, so you can do so by going to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Tegmark#Biography" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;">his Wikipedia page.</a></p>
